These primers were designed to differentiate the C. hallux (ASV13) genomes from other C. tuberculostearicum species complex genomes (incl sensu stricto C. tub/ASV3).

They have not been tested extensively in vivo but we include them here in case they are useful for screening an isolate collection. Any putative C. hallux should be confirmed by 16S and Whole Genome Sequencing
